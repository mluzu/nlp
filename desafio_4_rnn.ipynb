Their next target.  The name is Neo. Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room? He'll be contacting us again. Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable. Then the informant is real. You all look the same to me. Smith.  I am Agent Smith. And you are? The great Morpheus.  We meet at last. They won't make it. Hurry! The sewers.  Of course. No Lieutenant your men are already dead. I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now. The orders were for your protection. I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass. Lieutenant you were given specific orders -- Oh shit. Lieutenant? Oh God. What?! Should Tank I.D. it? That's the third white van I've seen. What? Weird. No way.  Not possible. He's gonna make it. All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly. You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming? I don't know... My computer... Something wrong man?  You look a little whiter than usual. Right... I know I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist. If you get caught using that -- Hallelujah!  You are my savior man! My own personal Jesus Christ! Two grand. You got the money? I know.  It's her fault. You're two hours late. It's Choi. Who is it? No! ... yes. Don't hate me Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you. Goddamn you Cypher! That's what you think.  They've promised to back me Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream. But you're out Cypher.  You can't go back. Oh I disagree Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean all I do is pull a plug here.  But there you watch a man die. The Matrix isn't real! Yes.  You see the truth is Trinity that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix. My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus. I'm tired Trinity.  I'm tired of this war I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship of being cold of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit. You killed them. You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this. An accident?! He had an accident. Cypher?  Where's Tank? Hello Trinity. Morpheus will take him when he's ready. I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know. Don't tell me you're a believer now? There's something about him isn't there? Yeah 'course I'm sure. Are you sure this line is clean? Hear what? Did you hear that? I intend to believe me.  Someone has to. If you have something to say I suggest you say it to Morpheus. You don't do you? I... it doesn't matter what I believe. Do you? Morpheus believes he is the One. We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others. Don't be ridiculous. I know but I felt like taking a shift. You weren't supposed to relieve me. Any time. Thanks... for the drink. Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off. How? Dead.  All dead. What happened to them? Five.  Since I've been here. How many were there? You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going. Really? I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One. Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that? ... Yeah. Why you're here? Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde brunette and redhead.  You want a drink? Do you always look at it encoded? The Matrix?  Yeah. Is that...? Midnight watch. What are you doing? No it's all right. Sorry. Whoa!  Shit Neo you scared the Bejeezus out of me. He's going to pop! I don't believe it!  I don't believe it! Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store. Just get me outta here. I got you. There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus someone's going to make a believer out of me. Cypher? I need an exit!  Fast! Operator. I know Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it. You can't use that until Neo is out! Five minutes.  Maybe six. How long? He's beginning to believe. What is he doing? We have no choice. They'll be able to track it. Give me your phone. What if he isn't the One Morpheus? How can you be so sure? We found him Trinity.  We finally found him. Shit!  Apoc? I got a fibrillation! Go. All right -- You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it. Goddamnit! Yes. Are they any agent? I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit. She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later Neo you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path. Morpheus the Oracle... she told me -- Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin! No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't! I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please Neo I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me. Morpheus I don't know -- Listen to me Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world. No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One not that he would find me. Did you believe in them too? Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them? Yes I do. And you still believe I'm the One? Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut. Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody I'm just a guy.  What did I do Morpheus?  Why me? That's why we're here. What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real wasn't.  The whole world my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore Morpheus. What do you believe in? I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it so what's the point? Why? Morpheus I don't think this is a good idea. That I would find the One. What did she tell you? Yes. She helped you? Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide Neo. She can help you find the path. And she's never wrong. She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past present or future.  There is only what is. How does she know? She would say she knows enough. And she knows what?  Everything? Of the Resistance. The beginning? Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning. So is this the same oracle that made the uh prophecy? What's going on? Set down in there. No Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready you won't have to. What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets? I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be. How? Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change. Look again. Yeah. No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress? I think I do. Do you understand Neo? What -- what lesson? This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson. The body cannot live without the mind. If you are killed in the Matrix you die here? Your mind makes it real. I thought it wasn't real. Because... I didn't think I would? Do you know why you didn't make it? I'm trying to free your mind Neo but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank load the jump program. I know what you're trying to do -- Do you think my being faster stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place? You -- you're too fast. How did I beat you? Show me. This is incredible.  I know kung fu. Your training. For what? Get some rest.  You're going to need it. I didn't say that it would be easy Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth. No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible! Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back toasting the new age.  I say almost funny. A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence? We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that at some point in the early Twenty-first Century all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I. What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses what you feel taste smell or see then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain. This isn't real? Wild isn't it? Right now we're inside a computer program? You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know. When? More important than what is when? Morpheus what's happened to me? What is this place? You've never used them before. Why do my eyes hurt? Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them. What are you doing? Far from it. ... am I dead? Be what?  Be real? This can't be... Have you ever had a dream Neo that you were so sure was real? What does that mean? The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location. That you are a slave Neo.  Like everyone else you were born into bondage kept inside a prison that you cannot smell taste or touch. A prison for your mind. What truth? The Matrix is everywhere it's all around us here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. Do you want to know what it is? The Matrix? Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what but it's there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about? I know exactly what you mean. Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life. Why not? No. Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate Neo? You're Morpheus you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you. Ironically this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me Neo why are you here? I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. You could say that. I imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole? Please.  Come.  Sit. It's an honor. Welcome Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed I am Morpheus. Go the the Adams Street bridge. ... Yes. Do you still want to meet? You're the One Neo.  You see you may have spent the last few years looking for me but I've spent most of my life looking for you. What do you know? They got to you first but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know you would probably be dead. The agents -- This line is tapped so I must be brief. There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you. No way no way this is crazy. There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it. No!  It's too far away. How do you know all this? Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it. Go!  Now! But what if...? The cubicle across from you is empty. I can guide you out but you have to do exactly what I say. How?! I'm not sure but if you don't want to find out you better get out of there. What the fuck do they want with me?! Yes. Holy fucking shit! Yes.  Now. Right now? Stand up and see for yourself. Who's coming for me? I've been looking for you Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you but unfortunately we have run out of time.  They're coming for you Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do. Morpheus... Hello Neo.  Do you know who this is? Hello? He is the One.  He is the One! How...?! Do it! I'm going to make the call. Yes sir. Tank charge the E.M.P. We're on our way -- Got one ready sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo. We need an exit. Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice sir! Tank. Good. Now left and that's it in front of you. I need the main wet-wall. Got it. Ten hours straight.  He's a machine. How is he? You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one will be up to you. What? Morpheus believes in you Neo and no one not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours. What do you mean without him? I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One. Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced. What's funny? Your next life maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go. What? Sorry kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something. I'm not the One. But you already know what I'm going to tell you. But what? Okay now I'm supposed to say 'Hmmm that's interesting but...' Then you say -- Honestly?  I don't know. So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One? Not too bright though. Who? You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you. How did you know...? I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it. Shit I'm sorry. That vase. What vase? I'd ask you to sit down but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase. Yeah. Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good don't they? You're the Oracle? I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you. Hello? Not yet. Can you fly that thing. I'm fine.  Come on we have to keep moving. Are you all right? It wasn't fast enough. You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast. Do what? Neo how did you do that? Yeah? No one has ever done anything like this. No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell because you aren't going anywhere else. No you're not. I'm coming with you. What are you doing? I believe I can bring him back. What? Because... Why? No Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true. I'm sorry I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters. No you... have to be. I'm not the One Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too. What? Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not. Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in! I have to. You can't! I'm going in after him. What are you doing? What choice? That I would have to make a choice... There has to be something that we can do. Goddamnit!  Goddamnit! I don't know.  It just went dead. What happened? Is Morpheus still alive Tank? Is Morpheus alive? We have to! We can't leave him! Go! A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something. What is it? It might have been.  I'm not sure. How much like it?  Was it the same cat? A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it. What happened?  What did you see? Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu. What did you just say? ... right as rain. Are you all right? She told me... What did she tell you? Yes. Did you go to her? No. Should I be? Are you worried? Is it? That's different. But an Oracle can. That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are. What does that mean? I used to eat there... Really good noodles. What? God... It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines. E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse. Easy Neo.  Easy. Get this thing out of me! It's going into replication. Uh-oh... We think you're bugged.  Try to relax. What is this thing? ... shit. And I know that's not where you want to be. Because you've been down there Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends. Why? Neo please you have to trust me. From you. From what? It's necessary Neo.  For our protection. What the hell is this?! When I asked him he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it. What is the Matrix? It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question. Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him. Who is? They're watching you Neo. Of what? Right now all I can tell you is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you. How did you do that? No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time. Do you want to go somewhere and talk? Most guys do. I just thought... you were a guy. What? Gee-zus. That was a long time ago. Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base? My name is Trinity. Who are you? I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time. How do you know that name? Hello Neo. Kick it in!  Kick it in! It's locked. Duck! Which way?  Which way? Mr. Wizard get me the fuck out of here! Operator. Guns.  Lots of guns. Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle... Because I believe in something. Why? I know that's what it looks like but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go. Neo this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back too but what you are talking about is suicide. The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me... What are you talking about? Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it? Neo this has to be done! Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening! Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything. What do they want? When it does Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know. Depends on the mind.  But eventually it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this. How much time? They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time. How? They're hacking his mind. What are they doing to him? The Oracle. See who? Hell yes! Hey Mikey he likes it!  Ready for more? Holy shit! Deep underground.  Near the earth's core where it's still warm.  You live long enough you might even see it. Where is it? The last human city.  The only place we got left. It's a city? If this war ended tomorrow Zion is where the party would be. Zion? Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer we are 100 percent pure old- fashioned home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion. You don't have... You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator. No. Morning.  Did you sleep? Hurry Neo. They've burned through the outer shields. I don't know.  I lost him. What just happened? I can't! An Agent!  You have to send me back! What the hell just happened? Neo! Tank I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter. Operator. Trinity we don't have any other choice. You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?! There is.  We have to pull the plug. Dozer? I'll be all right. Tank you're hurt. Got it. So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie. Cypher I thought -- You're not far from Cypher. We need an exit! He's alive. Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet. Tank it's me. Operator.\""]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_JD3WDoIOE7W","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633799461284,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":246,"user":{"displayName":"mariano
